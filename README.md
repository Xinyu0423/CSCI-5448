A

## Note for This Class
1. This class mainly teaches the knowledge needed in industry, such as various design patterns. This content will be useful later in the industry. And the project at the end of the course is also very interesting, so if you want to go into industry later this class is great.
2. There are a lot of design patterns that will be taught in this class, and it's ok that you probably won't be able to memorize all of them completely. But keep in mind that you will most likely need to use one or more of the design patterns taught in this class later in the industry
